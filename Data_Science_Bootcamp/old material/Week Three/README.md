# Week Three

This week we covered OLS assumptions. These assumptions include:

1) Independent and Identically Distributed Error Terms
2) No independent variables are correlated with any error terms
3) Error Terms uncorrelated with each other
4) Residuals are normally distributed and have constant variance
5) No multicollinearity

We also went futher in detail on Bias-Variance Tradeoff, the concept of Endogeneity, Autocorellation, Heteroskedasticity, and Multicollinearity. See the slides for more information

# This Week's Challenge:

We are extending the deadline for the Week Two Challenge! However, this week we want you to include analysis of multicollinearity and autocorellation in your code and slides. Make sure you're running VIF tests and checking your Durbin-Watson scores.

As always, if you have any questions, please email us.
