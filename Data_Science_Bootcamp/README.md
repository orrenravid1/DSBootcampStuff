# Data Science Bootcamp
## A collaboration between Rutgers Cognitive Science and Statistics Clubs
Welcome! This is a crash course in data science. Our goal is to give you the technical skills you need to stand out, make a difference, and feel confident enough to continue exploring on your own.

We'll be covering a wide range of material, from how to create beautiful visualizations of your data, to some of the most popular and powerful statistical and machine learning algorithms.
You'll find some of our materials from the Fall 2019 semester in the folder "old material". This semester you can expect a number of updated resources.
